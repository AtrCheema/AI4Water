"""
The transformation module consits of sklearn type classes to transform and
inverse transform data. The enhancement is that these transformations have a
config and from_config methods. Therefore we can save the transformation objects
in a json file and load from a json file. At the lowest level there are individual
transformations which perform transformation on single data. Then on top of that
is Transformation class, which does some data cleaning and preprocessing to perform
transformation on single array like. Then, at the highest level, there is
Transformations class which can be used to perform multiple transformation on
single array or multiple arrays.
