# dl4seq

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq)  

A uniform and siplified framework for rapid expermenting with deep leanring and machine learning based models
for time series and 1D data. 

The purpose of the repository is
* compliment the functionality of keras by making pre and post processing easeier for time-series prediction problems
* save, load/reload or build models from readable json file.
* both of above functionalities should be available without complicating simple keras implementation.
* provide a uniform `one window` interface for optimizing hyper-parameters using either Bayesian, random or grid search
  for any kind of model using `HyperOpt` class. This class sits on top of [BayesSearchCV](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/modules/generated/skopt.BayesSearchCV.html),
  [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV),
  [RandomizeSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV)
  but but has some extra functionalities. See [example](https://github.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq/blob/master/examples/hyper_para_opt.ipynb) using its application.
* It should be possible to overwrite/customize any of the functionality of the dl4seq's `Model` by subclassing the
 `Model`. So at the highest level you just need to initiate the `Model`, and then need `train`, `predict` and 
 `view_model` methods of `Model` class but you can go as low as you could go with tensorflow/keras. 

This repository provides a framework to build layered models using python dictionary and with several helper tools 
which fasten the process of  modeling time-series forcasting. The purpose is to cut the time to write boiler plate code
in developing deep learning based models.

Most of the models in this repository have been adopted from other repositories in order to create an `all in one` code.
I have tried to reference the original repositories as well.

This repository is for you if you want to
* avoid pre and post post processing of data to build data-driven models for 1D or time series data.
* want to save (in) and reload models from readable json config file.
* Customize some of the utilities provided here while retaining others e.g using your own normalization and denormalization 

Currently following models are implemented

`*` These models can be constructed by stacking layers in a python dictionary as shown in [examples](https://github.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq/blob/master/examples/build_dl_models.md). The remaining models 
can be used as shown [here](https://github.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq/blob/master/examples/build_dl_models.md)

## Installation

using github link

	python -m pip install git+https://github.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq.git

using setup file, go to folder where repo is downloaded

    python setup.py install

The latest code however (possibly with less bugs and more features) can be insalled from `exp` branch instead

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/AtrCheema/dl4seq.git@exp

## How to use

```python
import pandas as pd 
from dl4seq import InputAttentionModel  # import any of the above model
from dl4seq.utils import make_model  # helper function to make inputs for model

config = make_model(batch_size=16,
                    lookback=15,
                    lr=0.001)
df = pd.read_csv('data/data_30min.csv')  # path for data file

model = InputAttentionModel(
              config=config,
              data=df
              )

model.eda()  # perform comprehensive explanatory data analysis, check model.path directory for plots

history = model.train(indices='random')

preds, obs = model.predict()
acts = model.view_model()
```

## Using your own pre-processed data
You can use your own pre-processed data without using any of pre-processing tools of dl4seq. You will need to provide
input output paris to `data` argument to `train` and/or `predict` methods.
```python
import numpy as np
from dl4seq import InputAttentionModel  # import any of the above model
from dl4seq.utils import make_model  # helper function to make inputs for model

batch_size = 16
lookback = 15
inputs = ['dummy1', 'dummy2', 'dummy3', 'dumm4', 'dummy5']  # just dummy names for plotting and saving results.
outputs=['DummyTarget']
config = make_model(batch_size=batch_size,
                    lookback=lookback,
                    transformation=None,
                    inputs=inputs,
                    outputs=outputs,
                    lr=0.001)

model = InputAttentionModel(
              config=config,
              data=None
              )
x = np.random.random((batch_size*10, lookback, len(inputs)))
y = np.random.random((batch_size*10, len(outputs)))
data = (x,y)

history = model.train(data=data)

```

## using for `scikit-learn`/`xgboost` based models
The repository can also be used for scikit-learn/xgboost based models for both classification and regression
problems by making use of `ml_model` and `ml_model_args` keyword arguments in `make_model` function. However, integration
of ML based models is not complete yet.
```python
from dl4seq import Model
import pandas as pd
from dl4seq.utils import make_model  # helper function to make inputs for model

df = pd.read_csv('data/data_30min.csv')  # path for data file

config = make_model(batches="2d",
                    inputs=['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'],
                    outputs=['target7'],
                    lookback=1,
                    val_fraction=0.0,
                    ml_model="randomforestregressor",  #  any regressor from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html
                    ml_model_args={"n_estimators":1000}  # set any of regressor's parameters. e.g. for RandomForestRegressor above used,
    # some of the paramters are https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor
)

model = Model(config=config,
              data=df
              )

history = model.train(st=0, en=150)

preds, obs = model.predict(st=150, en=220)
```

## Disclaimer
Athough the purpose of this repo is purportedly `all_in_one` model, however there is no `one_for_all` model. For each
deep learning proble, the model needs to be build accordingly. I made this repo to teach myself deep learning for time
series prediction.
