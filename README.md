# dl_ts_prediction

Most of the models in this repository have been adopted from other repositories in order to create an `all in one` code. I have tried to reference the original repositories as well.

Currently following models are implemented

* LSTM
* CNN
* LST MCNN
* CNN LSTM
* LSTM Autoencoder
* Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
* Iterpretable Multivariate LSTM (IMV-LSTM)
* HARHN
* Neural Beats
* Dual Attention
* Input Attention
